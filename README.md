# Currency Converter (React)

![currency converter screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/2DsRsqK.png)

This mini project was built with ReactJS. The app makes API calls to https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/api/v6/convert?q=EUR_USD&compact=y for conversions between USD, EUR and SGD (all directions). The app utilizes [lscache](https://github.com/pamelafox/lscache) to store conversion rates in localstorage in order to make fewer API calls. Basic styling with Bootstrap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
